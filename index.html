		<h1>Christina Wiech</h1>

		<p>I am a former Associate Producer of non-fiction media with a liberal arts background who recently chose to take the plunge into the tech world. I am an aspiring front-end developer who believes in the power of storytelling and seeks to create user experiences that are both compelling and functional.</p>

		<p>When I'm not coding I'm most likely brewing beer, watching <em>The Americans</em>, trying to read all of Stephen King's books, listening to Fleetwood Mac or watching Notre Dame footabll.</p>
